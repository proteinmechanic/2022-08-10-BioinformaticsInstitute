<p>
  This workshop is inspired by the <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a> initiative and
  aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools and 
  participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
